# Falling_Utopia

-Summary-
In the year 3084, man has finally constructed floating cities called “Utopias”, cities that will never fall. The scientists who designed and planned the construction of the cities were so confident in the safety of the cities, no emergency vehicles or safety measures were planned in the event of a serious mishap. Unfortunately, on the day of the launch misfortune hits the cities and there was a great fire...the fire spread at an insane speed and the citizens evacuated to the tunnels below the floating cities that led to nowhere except a great fall. With no other choice, the citizens of Utopia began to leap to their deaths. A young smart soldier manning the cannon from the ground saw the falling citizens and quickly changed the rounds in his cannon to parachutes hoping to save as many lives as possible...but will the soldier succeed?
